**Parallel Algorithms and Programming Repository**
This repository explores advanced concepts in parallel computing and programming. It includes implementations and examples of:

1. Thread-based parallelism with static and dynamic load balancing.
2. Master-worker models for task distribution.
3. Message Passing Interface (MPI) for distributed memory systems.
4. MapReduce paradigms for processing large datasets.
5. CUDA programming for GPU-based acceleration.
   
The code and documentation aim to provide practical insights into designing and optimizing high-performance applications in various parallel computing environments.
